# Types

Each of the types contains reference to other type. It representes how data is stored in mongodb.

i did't liked the embedded documents style (cause it will quickly become redundant), so it uses references which you can learn more about [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/applications/data-models-relationships/).
